## Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is crucial for effectively using large language models. By crafting precise and well-structured prompts, you can significantly improve the model's performance and ensure that it produces relevant and accurate responses.

While prompt engineering sounds fancy, it isn’t an exact science and results will vary depending on the models being used. Prompt Engineering is valuable as a skill set but also a helpful framing technique. The real benefits comes from experimentation and being very intentional about the prompts that you craft.

### Types

Prompt engineering can involve several techniques, including:

1. **Zero-Shot Prompting**: Asking the model to perform a task without providing examples.
2. **Few-Shot Prompting**: Giving a few examples within the prompt to guide the model.
3. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Encouraging the model to explain its reasoning process step-by-step.
4. **Contextual Prompting**: Providing additional context or background information to improve the model’s responses.

### Examples
- **Text Classification**: "Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive. Text: 'This movie is great!' Sentiment: "
	- Here we are ‘pre-filling’ the response, so that the LLM can finish it off. Doing this increases the chance of getting a good response, because the number of likely different response for this start text is much smaller, than if it we left it open ended.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: "Extract the names of people, organizations, and places from the following text: 'John works at Hugging Face inNew York.'"
	- In this example, we clearly describe which ‘classes’ we are interested in, increasing the chance that we will get a meaningful response.
- **Translation**: "Translate the following sentence from English to French: 'Hello, how are you?' Translation: "
	- Again, we pre-fill the response text in the hopes of getting a more relevant result.
- **Content Generation**: "Write a short story about a dragon who wants to learn to cook"
	- This is a much more open ended prompt and great for more creative use cases such as content generation. Sometimes the unpredictable nature of LLMs is a huge benefit.

### Resources

To learn more about prompt engineering, you can explore the following resources:

1. **Prompt Engineering Guide**: A comprehensive guide that covers various techniques and applications of prompt engineering [promptingguide.ai](https://www.promptingguide.ai).
2. **GitHub Prompt Engineering Guide**: Offers practical tips and examples for developers [GitHub](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide).
3. **OpenAI Documentation**: Provides guidelines and best practices for using prompts with OpenAI models [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering).
4. **Hugging Face Prompting Guide**: Focuses on using Hugging Face models for various NLP tasks [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/tasks/prompting).
5. **Anthropic Prompt Engineering Guide**: Detailed documentation on prompting approaches for Anthropic models [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/prompt-engineering)
6. **Mistral Prompting Capabilities**: Focuses on suing Mistral models [Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/prompting_capabilities/)

While some of these resources are model specific, they are all full of very useful information and can be a great starting point for prompting any model. In many cases the general approaches detailed in the model-specific guides can be followed with any model.

In essence, you want to have a variety of techniques and approaches at your disposal and start experimenting, refining until you get results you are happy with.

Assessing the output on ‘feel’ is a perfectly acceptable approach until you decide you want to benchmark and assess results more systematically.
